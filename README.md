## Design pattern

**1. What are the main categories of Design Patterns?**

The three main categories of Design Patterns are:

1. **Creational Patterns**: Deal with object creation mechanisms
   - Singleton, Factory, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype
   - Focus on how objects are created and initialized

2. **Structural Patterns**: Deal with object composition and relationships
   - Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Proxy
   - Focus on how objects are structured and composed

3. **Behavioral Patterns**: Deal with communication between objects and assignment of responsibilities
   - Observer, Strategy, Command, State, Template Method, Chain of Responsibility, Mediator, Memento, Visitor, Iterator, Interpreter
   - Focus on how objects interact and distribute responsibilities

---

**2. What is Design Patterns and why anyone should use them?**

**Design Patterns** are reusable solutions to common problems that occur in software design. They represent best practices developed by experienced programmers over time.

**Why use Design Patterns:**
- **Reusability**: Proven solutions that can be applied to similar problems
- **Communication**: Provide a common vocabulary for developers
- **Best Practices**: Encapsulate years of experience and expertise
- **Maintainability**: Make code more organized and easier to maintain
- **Flexibility**: Create loosely coupled, extensible designs
- **Documentation**: Serve as templates for solving design problems
- **Quality**: Lead to more robust and reliable software

---

**3. What is a pattern?**

A **pattern** is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into code, but rather a template or blueprint for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.

**Key characteristics of a pattern:**
- **Name**: A descriptive and memorable name
- **Problem**: Description of when to apply the pattern
- **Solution**: Elements that make up the design, relationships, responsibilities
- **Consequences**: Results and trade-offs of applying the pattern

---

**4. What is Singleton pattern?**

The **Singleton pattern** ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.

**Implementation:**
```csharp
public class Singleton
{
    private static Singleton _instance;
    private static readonly object _lockObject = new object();
    
    private Singleton() { } // Private constructor
    
    public static Singleton Instance
    {
        get
        {
            if (_instance == null)
            {
                lock (_lockObject)
                {
                    if (_instance == null)
                        _instance = new Singleton();
                }
            }
            return _instance;
        }
    }
}
```

**Use cases:**
- Database connections
- Configuration settings
- Logging services
- Caching

**Pros:** Controlled access, reduced memory footprint, global access
**Cons:** Can make testing difficult, potential concurrency issues, violates Single Responsibility Principle

---

**5. What is Dependency Injection?**

**Dependency Injection (DI)** is a design pattern that implements Inversion of Control (IoC) for resolving dependencies. Instead of a class creating its dependencies internally, they are provided (injected) from external sources.

**Types of DI:**
1. **Constructor Injection**: Dependencies passed through constructor
2. **Property Injection**: Dependencies set through public properties
3. **Method Injection**: Dependencies passed as method parameters

**Example:**
```csharp
// Without DI
public class OrderService
{
    private EmailService emailService = new EmailService(); // Tight coupling
}

// With DI
public class OrderService
{
    private IEmailService emailService;
    
    public OrderService(IEmailService emailService) // Constructor injection
    {
        this.emailService = emailService;
    }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Loose coupling
- Easier testing (mock dependencies)
- Better maintainability
- Flexible configuration
- Separation of concerns

---

**6. What is State pattern?**

The **State pattern** allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object appears to change its class.

**Key components:**
- **Context**: Maintains a reference to a state object
- **State**: Defines interface for state-specific behavior
- **ConcreteState**: Implements behavior associated with a state

**Example:**
```csharp
public interface IState
{
    void Handle(Context context);
}

public class Context
{
    private IState state;
    
    public void SetState(IState state)
    {
        this.state = state;
    }
    
    public void Request()
    {
        state.Handle(this);
    }
}

public class ConcreteStateA : IState
{
    public void Handle(Context context)
    {
        // State-specific behavior
        context.SetState(new ConcreteStateB());
    }
}
```

**Use cases:** State machines, game character states, UI controls, workflow systems

---

**7. What is Null Object pattern?**

The **Null Object pattern** provides a default object with neutral behavior to represent the absence of an object, eliminating the need for null checks.

**Example:**
```csharp
public interface ILogger
{
    void Log(string message);
}

public class FileLogger : ILogger
{
    public void Log(string message)
    {
        // Write to file
    }
}

public class NullLogger : ILogger
{
    public void Log(string message)
    {
        // Do nothing - neutral behavior
    }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Eliminates null reference exceptions
- Simplifies code by removing null checks
- Provides default behavior
- More readable and maintainable code

---

**8. What is Template pattern?**

The **Template Method pattern** defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class, letting subclasses override specific steps without changing the algorithm's structure.

**Example:**
```csharp
public abstract class DataProcessor
{
    // Template method
    public void ProcessData()
    {
        ReadData();
        ProcessRawData();
        WriteData();
    }
    
    protected abstract void ReadData();
    protected abstract void ProcessRawData();
    protected abstract void WriteData();
}

public class CSVProcessor : DataProcessor
{
    protected override void ReadData() { /* Read CSV */ }
    protected override void ProcessRawData() { /* Process CSV data */ }
    protected override void WriteData() { /* Write processed data */ }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Code reuse
- Consistent algorithm structure
- Easy to extend
- Follows Hollywood Principle ("Don't call us, we'll call you")

---

**9. What is Iterator pattern?**

The **Iterator pattern** provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

**Example:**
```csharp
public interface IIterator<T>
{
    bool HasNext();
    T Next();
}

public class ListIterator<T> : IIterator<T>
{
    private List<T> list;
    private int position = 0;
    
    public ListIterator(List<T> list)
    {
        this.list = list;
    }
    
    public bool HasNext() => position < list.Count;
    
    public T Next() => list[position++];
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Uniform traversal interface
- Supports multiple simultaneous traversals
- Encapsulates iteration logic
- Simplifies collection interface

---

**10. What is Strategy pattern?**

The **Strategy pattern** defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable at runtime.

**Example:**
```csharp
public interface IPaymentStrategy
{
    void Pay(decimal amount);
}

public class CreditCardPayment : IPaymentStrategy
{
    public void Pay(decimal amount) { /* Credit card logic */ }
}

public class PayPalPayment : IPaymentStrategy
{
    public void Pay(decimal amount) { /* PayPal logic */ }
}

public class PaymentContext
{
    private IPaymentStrategy strategy;
    
    public void SetStrategy(IPaymentStrategy strategy)
    {
        this.strategy = strategy;
    }
    
    public void ExecutePayment(decimal amount)
    {
        strategy.Pay(amount);
    }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Runtime algorithm selection
- Easy to add new strategies
- Eliminates conditional statements
- Follows Open/Closed Principle

---

**11. What is Proxy pattern?**

The **Proxy pattern** provides a placeholder or surrogate for another object to control access to it.

**Types of Proxies:**
1. **Virtual Proxy**: Controls access to expensive-to-create objects
2. **Protection Proxy**: Controls access based on permissions
3. **Remote Proxy**: Represents objects in different address spaces
4. **Smart Proxy**: Adds additional behavior when accessing objects

**Example:**
```csharp
public interface IImage
{
    void Display();
}

public class RealImage : IImage
{
    private string filename;
    
    public RealImage(string filename)
    {
        this.filename = filename;
        LoadFromDisk();
    }
    
    private void LoadFromDisk()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Loading {filename}");
    }
    
    public void Display()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Displaying {filename}");
    }
}

public class ProxyImage : IImage
{
    private RealImage realImage;
    private string filename;
    
    public ProxyImage(string filename)
    {
        this.filename = filename;
    }
    
    public void Display()
    {
        if (realImage == null)
        {
            realImage = new RealImage(filename); // Lazy loading
        }
        realImage.Display();
    }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Controls access to objects
- Lazy initialization
- Caching and performance optimization
- Security and access control

**12. What are some benefits of Repository Pattern?**

The **Repository pattern** encapsulates data access logic and provides a uniform interface for accessing domain objects.

**Benefits:**
1. **Testability**: Easy to mock for unit testing
2. **Centralized Query Logic**: All queries for an entity type in one place
3. **Flexibility**: Can switch data sources without affecting business logic
4. **Separation of Concerns**: Isolates data access from business logic
5. **Consistency**: Provides consistent interface across different entities
6. **Caching**: Can implement caching at repository level
7. **Transaction Management**: Easier to manage transactions

**Example:**
```csharp
public interface IUserRepository
{
    User GetById(int id);
    IEnumerable<User> GetAll();
    void Add(User user);
    void Update(User user);
    void Delete(int id);
}

public class UserRepository : IUserRepository
{
    private readonly DbContext context;
    
    public UserRepository(DbContext context)
    {
        this.context = context;
    }
    
    public User GetById(int id) => context.Users.Find(id);
    // ... other implementations
}
```

---

**13. What is Filter pattern?**

The **Filter pattern** (also known as Criteria pattern) allows filtering objects based on different criteria and chaining them in a decoupled manner.

**Example:**
```csharp
public interface IFilter<T>
{
    IEnumerable<T> Filter(IEnumerable<T> items);
}

public class AndFilter<T> : IFilter<T>
{
    private IFilter<T> filter1;
    private IFilter<T> filter2;
    
    public AndFilter(IFilter<T> filter1, IFilter<T> filter2)
    {
        this.filter1 = filter1;
        this.filter2 = filter2;
    }
    
    public IEnumerable<T> Filter(IEnumerable<T> items)
    {
        return filter2.Filter(filter1.Filter(items));
    }
}

public class AgeFilter : IFilter<Person>
{
    private int minAge;
    
    public AgeFilter(int minAge)
    {
        this.minAge = minAge;
    }
    
    public IEnumerable<Person> Filter(IEnumerable<Person> people)
    {
        return people.Where(p => p.Age >= minAge);
    }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Flexible filtering logic
- Easy to combine filters
- Reusable filter components
- Clean separation of filter logic

---

**14. What is Builder pattern?**

The **Builder pattern** constructs complex objects step by step, allowing you to produce different types and representations using the same construction process.

**Example:**
```csharp
public class Computer
{
    public string CPU { get; set; }
    public string RAM { get; set; }
    public string Storage { get; set; }
    public string GPU { get; set; }
}

public class ComputerBuilder
{
    private Computer computer = new Computer();
    
    public ComputerBuilder SetCPU(string cpu)
    {
        computer.CPU = cpu;
        return this;
    }
    
    public ComputerBuilder SetRAM(string ram)
    {
        computer.RAM = ram;
        return this;
    }
    
    public ComputerBuilder SetStorage(string storage)
    {
        computer.Storage = storage;
        return this;
    }
    
    public ComputerBuilder SetGPU(string gpu)
    {
        computer.GPU = gpu;
        return this;
    }
    
    public Computer Build() => computer;
}

// Usage
var computer = new ComputerBuilder()
    .SetCPU("Intel i7")
    .SetRAM("16GB")
    .SetStorage("1TB SSD")
    .Build();
```

**Benefits:**
- Control over construction process
- Fluent interface

**16. What is Inversion of Control?**

**Inversion of Control (IoC)** is a design principle where the control of object creation and dependency management is transferred from the object itself to an external container or framework.

**Key Concepts:**
- Objects don't create their dependencies directly
- Dependencies are provided by external mechanism
- Reduces coupling between classes
- Makes code more testable and maintainable

**Implementation Methods:**
1. **Dependency Injection**: Constructor, Property, or Method injection
2. **Service Locator**: Central registry for services
3. **Factory Pattern**: Factory creates and manages dependencies
4. **Template Method**: Framework calls application code

**Benefits:**
- Loose coupling
- Better testability
- Easier maintenance
- Flexible configuration
- Separation of concerns

**17. Why would you want to use a Repository Pattern with an ORM?**

While ORMs provide data access capabilities, the Repository pattern adds additional benefits:

**Reasons to use Repository with ORM:**

1. **Abstraction Layer**: Hides ORM-specific details from business logic
2. **Testability**: Easy to mock repository for unit testing
3. **Centralized Queries**: Business-specific queries in one place
4. **Query Reusability**: Common queries can be reused across application
5. **Caching**: Implement caching at repository level
6. **Validation**: Business rule validation before data persistence
7. **Domain-Specific Methods**: Methods that make sense for business domain
8. **Future Flexibility**: Easier to switch ORMs or data sources

**Example:**
```csharp
public interface IUserRepository
{
    Task<User> GetActiveUserByEmailAsync(string email);
    Task<IEnumerable<User>> GetUsersWithExpiredSubscriptionsAsync();
    Task<bool> IsEmailUniqueAsync(string email);
}

public class UserRepository : IUserRepository
{
    private readonly DbContext context;
    
    public async Task<User> GetActiveUserByEmailAsync(string email)
    {
        return await context.Users
            .Where(u => u.Email == email && u.IsActive)
            .FirstOrDefaultAsync();
    }
}
```
