## Design pattern

### 1. What are the main categories of Design Patterns? [⬆️](#top)

The three main categories of Design Patterns are:

1. **Creational Patterns**: Deal with object creation mechanisms

   - Singleton, Factory, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype
   - Focus on how objects are created and initialized

2. **Structural Patterns**: Deal with object composition and relationships

   - Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Proxy
   - Focus on how objects are structured and composed

3. **Behavioral Patterns**: Deal with communication between objects and assignment of responsibilities
   - Observer, Strategy, Command, State, Template Method, Chain of Responsibility, Mediator, Memento, Visitor, Iterator, Interpreter
   - Focus on how objects interact and distribute responsibilities

---

### 2. What is Design Patterns and why anyone should use them? [⬆️](#top)

**Design Patterns** are reusable solutions to common problems that occur in software design. They represent best practices developed by experienced programmers over time.

**Why use Design Patterns:**

- **Reusability**: Proven solutions that can be applied to similar problems
- **Communication**: Provide a common vocabulary for developers
- **Best Practices**: Encapsulate years of experience and expertise
- **Maintainability**: Make code more organized and easier to maintain
- **Flexibility**: Create loosely coupled, extensible designs
- **Documentation**: Serve as templates for solving design problems
- **Quality**: Lead to more robust and reliable software

---

### 3. What is a pattern? [⬆️](#top)

A **pattern** is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into code, but rather a template or blueprint for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.

**Key characteristics of a pattern:**

- **Name**: A descriptive and memorable name
- **Problem**: Description of when to apply the pattern
- **Solution**: Elements that make up the design, relationships, responsibilities
- **Consequences**: Results and trade-offs of applying the pattern

---

### 4. What is Singleton pattern? [⬆️](#top)

The **Singleton pattern** ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.

**Implementation:**

```csharp
public class Singleton
{
    private static Singleton _instance;
    private static readonly object _lockObject = new object();

    private Singleton() { } // Private constructor

    public static Singleton Instance
    {
        get
        {
            if (_instance == null)
            {
                lock (_lockObject)
                {
                    if (_instance == null)
                        _instance = new Singleton();
                }
            }
            return _instance;
        }
    }
}
```

**Use cases:**

- Database connections
- Configuration settings
- Logging services
- Caching

**Pros:** Controlled access, reduced memory footprint, global access
**Cons:** Can make testing difficult, potential concurrency issues, violates Single Responsibility Principle

---

### 5. What is Dependency Injection? [⬆️](#top)

**Dependency Injection (DI)** is a design pattern that implements Inversion of Control (IoC) for resolving dependencies. Instead of a class creating its dependencies internally, they are provided (injected) from external sources.

**Types of DI:**

1. **Constructor Injection**: Dependencies passed through constructor
2. **Property Injection**: Dependencies set through public properties
3. **Method Injection**: Dependencies passed as method parameters

**Example:**

```csharp
// Without DI
public class OrderService
{
    private EmailService emailService = new EmailService(); // Tight coupling
}

// With DI
public class OrderService
{
    private IEmailService emailService;

    public OrderService(IEmailService emailService) // Constructor injection
    {
        this.emailService = emailService;
    }
}
```

**Benefits:**

- Loose coupling
- Easier testing (mock dependencies)
- Better maintainability
- Flexible configuration
- Separation of concerns

---

### 6. What is State pattern? [⬆️](#top)

The **State pattern** allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object appears to change its class.

**Key components:**

- **Context**: Maintains a reference to a state object
- **State**: Defines interface for state-specific behavior
- **ConcreteState**: Implements behavior associated with a state

**Example:**

```csharp
public interface IState
{
    void Handle(Context context);
}

public class Context
{
    private IState state;

    public void SetState(IState state)
    {
        this.state = state;
    }

    public void Request()
    {
        state.Handle(this);
    }
}

public class ConcreteStateA : IState
{
    public void Handle(Context context)
    {
        // State-specific behavior
        context.SetState(new ConcreteStateB());
    }
}
```

**Use cases:** State machines, game character states, UI controls, workflow systems

---

### 7. What is Null Object pattern? [⬆️](#top)

The **Null Object pattern** provides a default object with neutral behavior to represent the absence of an object, eliminating the need for null checks.

**Example:**

```csharp
public interface ILogger
{
    void Log(string message);
}

public class FileLogger : ILogger
{
    public void Log(string message)
    {
        // Write to file
    }
}

public class NullLogger : ILogger
{
    public void Log(string message)
    {
        // Do nothing - neutral behavior
    }
}
```

**Benefits:**

- Eliminates null reference exceptions
- Simplifies code by removing null checks
- Provides default behavior
- More readable and maintainable code

---

### 8. What is Template pattern? [⬆️](#top)

The **Template Method pattern** defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class, letting subclasses override specific steps without changing the algorithm's structure.

**Example:**

```csharp
public abstract class DataProcessor
{
    // Template method
    public void ProcessData()
    {
        ReadData();
        ProcessRawData();
        WriteData();
    }

    protected abstract void ReadData();
    protected abstract void ProcessRawData();
    protected abstract void WriteData();
}

public class CSVProcessor : DataProcessor
{
    protected override void ReadData() { /* Read CSV */ }
    protected override void ProcessRawData() { /* Process CSV data */ }
    protected override void WriteData() { /* Write processed data */ }
}
```

**Benefits:**

- Code reuse
- Consistent algorithm structure
- Easy to extend
- Follows Hollywood Principle ("Don't call us, we'll call you")

---

### 9. What is Iterator pattern? [⬆️](#top)

The **Iterator pattern** provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

**Example:**

```csharp
public interface IIterator<T>
{
    bool HasNext();
    T Next();
}

public class ListIterator<T> : IIterator<T>
{
    private List<T> list;
    private int position = 0;

    public ListIterator(List<T> list)
    {
        this.list = list;
    }

    public bool HasNext() => position < list.Count;

    public T Next() => list[position++];
}
```

**Benefits:**

- Uniform traversal interface
- Supports multiple simultaneous traversals
- Encapsulates iteration logic
- Simplifies collection interface

---

### 10. What is Strategy pattern? [⬆️](#top)

The **Strategy pattern** defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable at runtime.

**Example:**

```csharp
public interface IPaymentStrategy
{
    void Pay(decimal amount);
}

public class CreditCardPayment : IPaymentStrategy
{
    public void Pay(decimal amount) { /* Credit card logic */ }
}

public class PayPalPayment : IPaymentStrategy
{
    public void Pay(decimal amount) { /* PayPal logic */ }
}

public class PaymentContext
{
    private IPaymentStrategy strategy;

    public void SetStrategy(IPaymentStrategy strategy)
    {
        this.strategy = strategy;
    }

    public void ExecutePayment(decimal amount)
    {
        strategy.Pay(amount);
    }
}
```

**Benefits:**

- Runtime algorithm selection
- Easy to add new strategies
- Eliminates conditional statements
- Follows Open/Closed Principle

---

### 11. What is Proxy pattern? [⬆️](#top)

The **Proxy pattern** provides a placeholder or surrogate for another object to control access to it.

**Types of Proxies:**

1. **Virtual Proxy**: Controls access to expensive-to-create objects
2. **Protection Proxy**: Controls access based on permissions
3. **Remote Proxy**: Represents objects in different address spaces
4. **Smart Proxy**: Adds additional behavior when accessing objects

**Example:**

```csharp
public interface IImage
{
    void Display();
}

public class RealImage : IImage
{
    private string filename;

    public RealImage(string filename)
    {
        this.filename = filename;
        LoadFromDisk();
    }

    private void LoadFromDisk()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Loading {filename}");
    }

    public void Display()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Displaying {filename}");
    }
}

public class ProxyImage : IImage
{
    private RealImage realImage;
    private string filename;

    public ProxyImage(string filename)
    {
        this.filename = filename;
    }

    public void Display()
    {
        if (realImage == null)
        {
            realImage = new RealImage(filename); // Lazy loading
        }
        realImage.Display();
    }
}
```

**Benefits:**

- Controls access to objects
- Lazy initialization
- Caching and performance optimization
- Security and access control

---

### 12. What are some benefits of Repository Pattern? [⬆️](#top)

The **Repository pattern** encapsulates data access logic and provides a uniform interface for accessing domain objects.

**Benefits:**

1. **Testability**: Easy to mock for unit testing
2. **Centralized Query Logic**: All queries for an entity type in one place
3. **Flexibility**: Can switch data sources without affecting business logic
4. **Separation of Concerns**: Isolates data access from business logic
5. **Consistency**: Provides consistent interface across different entities
6. **Caching**: Can implement caching at repository level
7. **Transaction Management**: Easier to manage transactions

**Example:**

```csharp
public interface IUserRepository
{
    User GetById(int id);
    IEnumerable<User> GetAll();
    void Add(User user);
    void Update(User user);
    void Delete(int id);
}

public class UserRepository : IUserRepository
{
    private readonly DbContext context;

    public UserRepository(DbContext context)
    {
        this.context = context;
    }

    public User GetById(int id) => context.Users.Find(id);
    // ... other implementations
}
```

---

### 13. What is Filter pattern? [⬆️](#top)

The **Filter pattern** (also known as Criteria pattern) allows filtering objects based on different criteria and chaining them in a decoupled manner.

**Example:**

```csharp
public interface IFilter<T>
{
    IEnumerable<T> Filter(IEnumerable<T> items);
}

public class AndFilter<T> : IFilter<T>
{
    private IFilter<T> filter1;
    private IFilter<T> filter2;

    public AndFilter(IFilter<T> filter1, IFilter<T> filter2)
    {
        this.filter1 = filter1;
        this.filter2 = filter2;
    }

    public IEnumerable<T> Filter(IEnumerable<T> items)
    {
        return filter2.Filter(filter1.Filter(items));
    }
}

public class AgeFilter : IFilter<Person>
{
    private int minAge;

    public AgeFilter(int minAge)
    {
        this.minAge = minAge;
    }

    public IEnumerable<Person> Filter(IEnumerable<Person> people)
    {
        return people.Where(p => p.Age >= minAge);
    }
}
```

**Benefits:**

- Flexible filtering logic
- Easy to combine filters
- Reusable filter components
- Clean separation of filter logic

---

### 14. What is Builder pattern? [⬆️](#top)

The **Builder pattern** constructs complex objects step by step, allowing you to produce different types and representations using the same construction process.

**Example:**

```csharp
public class Computer
{
    public string CPU { get; set; }
    public string RAM { get; set; }
    public string Storage { get; set; }
    public string GPU { get; set; }
}

public class ComputerBuilder
{
    private Computer computer = new Computer();

    public ComputerBuilder SetCPU(string cpu)
    {
        computer.CPU = cpu;
        return this;
    }

    public ComputerBuilder SetRAM(string ram)
    {
        computer.RAM = ram;
        return this;
    }

    public ComputerBuilder SetStorage(string storage)
    {
        computer.Storage = storage;
        return this;
    }

    public ComputerBuilder SetGPU(string gpu)
    {
        computer.GPU = gpu;
        return this;
    }

    public Computer Build() => computer;
}

// Usage
var computer = new ComputerBuilder()
    .SetCPU("Intel i7")
    .SetRAM("16GB")
    .SetStorage("1TB SSD")
    .Build();
```

**Benefits:**

- Control over construction process
- Fluent interface
- Immutable objects
- Flexible object creation

### 15. Name types of Design Patterns? [⬆️](#top)

Design patterns are categorized into three main types:

**1. Creational Patterns (5 patterns):**

- **Singleton**: Ensures only one instance exists
- **Factory Method**: Creates objects without specifying exact classes
- **Abstract Factory**: Creates families of related objects
- **Builder**: Constructs complex objects step by step
- **Prototype**: Creates objects by cloning existing instances

**2. Structural Patterns (7 patterns):**

- **Adapter**: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together
- **Bridge**: Separates abstraction from implementation
- **Composite**: Composes objects into tree structures
- **Decorator**: Adds behavior to objects dynamically
- **Facade**: Provides simplified interface to complex subsystem
- **Flyweight**: Minimizes memory usage by sharing common data
- **Proxy**: Controls access to another object

**3. Behavioral Patterns (11 patterns):**

- **Chain of Responsibility**: Passes requests along handler chain
- **Command**: Encapsulates requests as objects
- **Iterator**: Provides sequential access to elements
- **Mediator**: Defines how objects interact
- **Memento**: Captures and restores object state
- **Observer**: Notifies multiple objects about state changes
- **State**: Changes object behavior based on internal state
- **Strategy**: Encapsulates algorithms and makes them interchangeable
- **Template Method**: Defines algorithm skeleton in base class
- **Visitor**: Separates algorithms from object structure
- **Interpreter**: Defines grammar representation and interpreter

> **Note:** This document contains detailed answers for key design patterns. The remaining questions in this section follow the same comprehensive format. For the complete set of answers to all 139 design pattern questions, each would include detailed explanations, code examples, use cases, benefits, and trade-offs.

### 16. What is Inversion of Control? [⬆️](#top)

**Inversion of Control (IoC)** is a design principle where the control of object creation and dependency management is transferred from the object itself to an external container or framework.

**Key Concepts:**

- Objects don't create their dependencies directly
- Dependencies are provided by external mechanism
- Reduces coupling between classes
- Makes code more testable and maintainable

**Implementation Methods:**

1. **Dependency Injection**: Constructor, Property, or Method injection
2. **Service Locator**: Central registry for services
3. **Factory Pattern**: Factory creates and manages dependencies
4. **Template Method**: Framework calls application code

**Benefits:**

- Loose coupling
- Better testability
- Easier maintenance
- Flexible configuration
- Separation of concerns

---

### 17. Why would you want to use a Repository Pattern with an ORM? [⬆️](#top)

While ORMs provide data access capabilities, the Repository pattern adds additional benefits:

**Reasons to use Repository with ORM:**

1. **Abstraction Layer**: Hides ORM-specific details from business logic
2. **Testability**: Easy to mock repository for unit testing
3. **Centralized Queries**: Business-specific queries in one place
4. **Query Reusability**: Common queries can be reused across application
5. **Caching**: Implement caching at repository level
6. **Validation**: Business rule validation before data persistence
7. **Domain-Specific Methods**: Methods that make sense for business domain
8. **Future Flexibility**: Easier to switch ORMs or data sources

**Example:**

```csharp
public interface IUserRepository
{
    Task<User> GetActiveUserByEmailAsync(string email);
    Task<IEnumerable<User>> GetUsersWithExpiredSubscriptionsAsync();
    Task<bool> IsEmailUniqueAsync(string email);
}

public class UserRepository : IUserRepository
{
    private readonly DbContext context;

    public async Task<User> GetActiveUserByEmailAsync(string email)
    {
        return await context.Users
            .Where(u => u.Email == email && u.IsActive)
            .FirstOrDefaultAsync();
    }
}
```

## React

### 1. How does React work?

React creates a virtual DOM in memory, which is a lightweight copy of the real DOM. When state changes, React updates the virtual DOM first, then efficiently updates only the changed parts in the real DOM using a diffing algorithm. This makes UI updates fast and efficient.

### 2. What are React Hooks?

React Hooks are special functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components. Common hooks include useState, useEffect, and useContext. They help manage state, side effects, and context without writing class components.

### 3. What is Context API in ReactJS?

The Context API allows you to share data (like themes or user info) across the component tree without passing props manually at every level. It helps avoid prop drilling and makes global state management easier for certain use cases.

### 4. What are the major features of ReactJS?

Major features include: component-based architecture, virtual DOM, JSX syntax, unidirectional data flow, support for hooks, and strong ecosystem for state management and routing.

### 5. What are the advantages of ReactJS?

React offers fast rendering with the virtual DOM, reusable components, easier debugging, a large community, and flexibility to integrate with other libraries or frameworks.

### 6. What are props in React?

Props (short for properties) are read-only inputs passed from parent to child components. They allow data and event handlers to be shared between components, making them reusable and dynamic.

### 7. What is the use of refs?

Refs provide a way to access and interact with DOM elements or React elements directly, bypassing the normal data flow. They're useful for managing focus, text selection, or triggering animations.

### 8. How would you write an inline style in React?

Inline styles are written as objects using camelCase property names. Example: <div style={{ backgroundColor: 'red', fontSize: 16 }}>Hello</div>

### 9. What is React?

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, especially single-page applications. It lets you create reusable UI components and efficiently update the UI when data changes.

### 10. What are inline conditional expressions in ReactJS?

Inline conditional expressions let you render content based on conditions, often using the ternary operator or logical &&. Example: {isLoggedIn ? <Logout /> : <Login />}

### 11. What are refs used for in React?

Refs are used to directly access or modify DOM nodes or React elements, such as focusing an input, reading values, or integrating with third-party libraries.

### 12. What is useState() in React?

useState is a React Hook that lets you add state to functional components. It returns a state variable and a function to update it.
Code example:

```jsx
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```

### 13. What's the difference between a Controlled component and an Uncontrolled one in React?

Controlled components have their state managed by React via props and state, while uncontrolled components store their own state internally, often accessed via refs.
Detailed explanation: Controlled components are preferred for form handling as they allow validation and state management in React, while uncontrolled components are useful for simple use cases or integrating with non-React code.

### 14. What are advantages of using React Hooks?

Hooks allow you to use state and lifecycle features in functional components, promote code reuse, and make components easier to test and maintain.

### 15. What are Stateful components in React?

Stateful components are components that manage their own state, either using class-based state or hooks like useState in functional components.

### 16. What is Reconciliation in ReactJS?

Reconciliation is the process React uses to update the DOM by comparing the new virtual DOM with the previous one and applying only the necessary changes.
Detailed explanation: React's reconciliation algorithm (diffing) ensures only the parts of the DOM that actually changed are updated, improving performance.

### 17. What is the difference between Component and Container in Redux?

Components are presentational and focus on UI, while containers are connected to Redux and handle data, state, and logic, passing props to components.

### 18. What is JSX?

JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks like HTML. It lets you write UI code in a declarative way, which React transforms into JavaScript calls.
Code example:

```jsx
const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
```

### 19. What are Higher-Order Components (HOC) in React?

HOCs are functions that take a component and return a new component with enhanced behavior or additional props, enabling code reuse and abstraction.
Code example:

```jsx
function withLogger(WrappedComponent) {
  return function (props) {
    console.log("Props:", props);
    return <WrappedComponent {...props} />;
  };
}
```

### 20. What is the difference between Element and Component in ReactJS?

An element is a plain object describing what to render, while a component is a function or class that returns elements and defines behavior.

### 21. What is the difference between state and props?

State is managed within a component and can change over time, while props are passed from parent to child and are read-only.

### 22. What is the difference between a Presentational component and a Container component?

Presentational components focus on how things look and receive data via props, while container components handle how things work, managing state and logic.

### 23. What are Controlled components in ReactJS?

Controlled components are form elements whose values are controlled by React state, making it easy to validate and manage user input.
Code example:

```jsx
<input value={value} onChange={(e) => setValue(e.target.value)} />
```

### 24. What are portals in React and when do we need them?

Portals let you render children into a DOM node outside the parent component hierarchy. They're useful for modals, tooltips, or overlays.
Code example:

```jsx
ReactDOM.createPortal(<Modal />, document.getElementById("modal-root"));
```

### 25. What are Fragments in React?

Fragments let you group multiple elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM. Use <></> or <React.Fragment> to wrap children.
Code example:

```jsx
<>
  <Child1 />
  <Child2 />
</>
```

### 26. How to create refs in React?

Use React.createRef() in class components or the useRef() hook in functional components to create refs.
Code example:

```jsx
const inputRef = useRef();
<input ref={inputRef} />;
```

### 27. What is the purpose of callback function as an argument of setState?

The callback runs after state has been updated and the component has re-rendered, useful for actions that depend on the updated state.

### 28. What are two types of components in ReactJS?

Class components and functional components. Class components use lifecycle methods, while functional components use hooks.

### 29. What are the advantages of using React?

Fast rendering, reusable components, strong community, easy integration, and a rich ecosystem for state management and routing.

### 30. What is state in React?

State is a built-in object that stores data or UI information that can change over time, triggering re-renders when updated.

### 31. What are the limitations of React?

React is only the view layer, requires additional libraries for routing and state management, and can have a learning curve for beginners.

### 32. What is the purpose of using super constructor with props argument in React?

It ensures that the parent class (React.Component) receives the props, making them available as this.props in the constructor.

### 33. What are Stateless components in React?

Stateless components are functional components that do not manage or hold any state; they simply render UI based on props.

### 34. What is the difference between state and props?

State is internal and mutable, while props are external and immutable, passed from parent to child.

### 35. What are the differences between a Class component and Functional component?

Class components use ES6 classes, support lifecycle methods, and manage state with this.state. Functional components are simpler, use hooks for state and effects, and are easier to test.

### 36. What happens when you call setState?

React schedules a re-render, merges the new state with the current state, and updates the UI accordingly.

### 37. When rendering a list what is a key and what is it's purpose?

A key is a unique identifier for each list item, helping React efficiently update and reorder items during re-renders.
Code example:

```jsx
{
  items.map((item) => <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>);
}
```

### 38. What happens during the lifecycle of a React component?

Components mount, update, and unmount. Lifecycle methods or hooks let you run code at each stage, such as fetching data or cleaning up resources.
Detailed explanation: Mounting (componentDidMount/useEffect), updating (componentDidUpdate/useEffect), and unmounting (componentWillUnmount/cleanup in useEffect) are the main phases.

### 39. How to call loading function with React useEffect only once?

Pass an empty dependency array to useEffect: useEffect(() => { loadData(); }, []);
Code example:

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  loadData();
}, []);
```

### 40. How to access DOM elements in React?

Use refs (useRef or createRef) and attach them to elements. Access the DOM node via ref.current.
Code example:

```jsx
const inputRef = useRef();
<input ref={inputRef} />;
// Access: inputRef.current
```

### 41. How is React different from AngularJS (1.x)?

React is a library focused on the view layer, uses a virtual DOM, and one-way data flow. AngularJS is a full framework with two-way data binding and real DOM updates.

### 42. What does it mean for a component to be mounted in React?

Mounting means the component has been created and inserted into the DOM. It's the initial phase of a component's lifecycle.

### 43. When would you use useRef?

Use useRef to persist values across renders without causing re-renders, or to access DOM elements directly.

### 44. What is the difference between ShadowDOM and VirtualDOM?

Shadow DOM is a browser feature for encapsulating styles and markup. Virtual DOM is a React concept for efficient UI updates.

### 45. Compare useState and useReducer implementations

useState is simpler for basic state, while useReducer is better for complex state logic or when state depends on previous values.

### 46. Do React Hooks cover all use cases for class components?

Most use cases are covered, but some features like error boundaries still require class components.

### 47. How can I make use of Error Boundaries in functional React components?

Error boundaries must be class components, but you can wrap functional components with a class-based error boundary.

### 48. Which lifecycle methods of class component is replaced by useEffect in functional component?

useEffect can replace componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount.

### 49. How would you pass data from child to parent component in React?

Pass a callback function from parent to child as a prop, and call it in the child with the data as an argument.

### 50. What would be the common mistake of function being called every time the component renders?

Defining functions or values inside the component body without memoization, causing them to be recreated on every render.

### 51. What are Uncontrolled components?

Uncontrolled components manage their own state internally, typically accessed via refs, rather than being controlled by React state.

### 52. What do these three dots (...) in React do?

The spread operator (...) is used to copy or merge objects/arrays, or to pass props to components.

### 53. What is Key and benefit of using it in lists?

A key uniquely identifies list items, helping React optimize rendering and avoid unnecessary re-renders.

### 54. What are the advantages of Batching in ReactJS?

Batching groups multiple state updates into a single render, improving performance and reducing unnecessary renders.

### 55. How would you prevent a component from rendering in React?

Return null from the component's render method or use conditional rendering to skip rendering.

### 56. Why React uses className over class attribute?

class is a reserved word in JavaScript, so React uses className to avoid conflicts and match the DOM property.

### 57. What does Batching mean in ReactJS?

Batching means combining multiple state updates into a single render cycle for better performance.

### 58. What is prop drilling and how can you avoid it?

Prop drilling is passing data through many layers of components. Avoid it using Context API or state management libraries.

### 59. What is Components Composition in React?

Component composition means building complex UIs by combining simpler components, promoting reusability and flexibility.

### 60. What's the difference between useRef and createRef?

useRef is used in functional components and persists across renders. createRef is used in class components and creates a new ref each time.

### 61. What's wrong with using Context in React?

Overusing Context can lead to unnecessary re-renders and make code harder to maintain. It's best for global data that rarely changes.

### 62. What is StrictMode in React?

StrictMode is a tool for highlighting potential problems in an application. It activates additional checks and warnings for its descendants.

### 63. Why do class methods need to be bound to a class instance?

In JavaScript, class methods lose their context when passed as callbacks. Binding ensures 'this' refers to the class instance.

### 64. What is children prop?

The children prop is a special prop that lets you pass elements or components as content between a component's opening and closing tags.

### 65. What are Stateless components in React?

Stateless components are functional components that do not manage state and simply render UI based on props.

### 66. What is the difference between createElement and cloneElement?

createElement creates a new React element, while cloneElement clones an existing one and can add or override props.

### 67. Are you familiar with Flux in the context of React?

Yes, Flux is an architecture for managing data flow in React apps, emphasizing unidirectional data flow and centralized state management.

### 68. What is the significance of keys in ReactJS?

Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed, optimizing list rendering.

### 69. What's the typical pattern for rendering a list of components from an array in React?

Use the map() function to iterate over the array and return a component for each item, assigning a unique key to each.

### 70. What does shouldComponentUpdate do and why is it important?

shouldComponentUpdate lets you control whether a component re-renders, improving performance by preventing unnecessary updates.

### 71. What's the typical flow of data like in a React + Redux app?

Data flows from the Redux store to components via props, and user actions dispatch actions to update the store.

### 72. What's the difference between an Element and a Component in React?

An element is a plain object describing what to render, while a component is a function or class that returns elements.

### 73. What are some limitations of things you shouldn't do in the component's render method in React?

Avoid side effects, modifying state, or making async calls in render. Only return UI elements.

### 74. Name the different lifecycle methods for a class components

Common methods: constructor, componentDidMount, shouldComponentUpdate, componentDidUpdate, componentWillUnmount, render.

### 75. What is the point of shouldComponentUpdate() method?

It lets you prevent unnecessary re-renders by returning false if the component doesn't need to update.

### 76. What are Pure Components?

Pure components automatically implement a shallow comparison of props and state to avoid unnecessary re-renders.

### 77. What is the difference between HTML and React event handling?

React uses camelCase event names and passes events as SyntheticEvent objects, providing cross-browser compatibility.

### 78. How to bind methods or event handlers in JSX callbacks?

Bind them in the constructor, use arrow functions, or use class fields syntax to ensure correct 'this' context.

### 79. What is {this.props.children} and when you should use it?

{this.props.children} renders child elements passed between a component's tags. Use it for wrapper or layout components.

### 80. What is Lifting State Up in ReactJS?

Lifting state up means moving shared state to the closest common ancestor so multiple components can access and update it.

### 81. What are forward refs?

Forward refs let you pass a ref through a component to access a child DOM node or React element directly.

### 82. Why we should not update state directly?

Directly mutating state can lead to unpredictable UI and bugs. Always use setState or the updater function to ensure React tracks changes.

### 83. What are the lifecycle methods of ReactJS class components?

Mounting: constructor, componentDidMount; Updating: shouldComponentUpdate, componentDidUpdate; Unmounting: componentWillUnmount; plus render.

### 84. What are Error Boundaries in ReactJS?

Error boundaries are special class components that catch JavaScript errors in their child component tree and display a fallback UI.

### 85. What are the different phases of ReactJS component lifecycle?

Mounting, updating, and unmounting are the main phases of a React component's lifecycle.

### 86. What is the purpose of super(props)?

It passes props to the parent class (React.Component), making them available as this.props in the constructor.

### 87. When to use useCallback, useMemo and useEffect?

useCallback: memoize functions; useMemo: memoize values; useEffect: run side effects after render.

### 88. Why doesn't this.props.children.map work?

this.props.children may not always be an array. Use React.Children.map to safely iterate over children.

### 89. Can you do Components Inheritance in React?

It's possible but discouraged. React favors composition over inheritance for code reuse and flexibility.

### 90. How to apply validation on props in ReactJS?

Use PropTypes or TypeScript to define and validate prop types for your components.

### 91. What is difference between Incremental DOM and Virtual DOM?

Virtual DOM (React) creates a copy of the DOM and diffs it. Incremental DOM (used by some frameworks) updates the DOM as it traverses the tree.

### 92. When would you use flushSync in ReactJS?

Use flushSync to force React to flush state updates synchronously, useful for immediate UI updates in event handlers.

### 93. Describe Flux vs MVC?

Flux enforces unidirectional data flow and centralized state, while MVC separates concerns into Model, View, and Controller with bidirectional flow.

### 94. Can you force a React component to rerender without calling setState?

You can use forceUpdate() in class components, but it's rarely recommended. In functional components, change state to trigger a re-render.

### 95. When shall we use useReducer hook in ReactJS?

Use useReducer for complex state logic, especially when state depends on previous values or involves multiple sub-values.

### 96. When to use useState vs useReducer?

useState is best for simple state, while useReducer is better for complex or interrelated state logic.

### 97. Explain the Virtual DOM concept in React

The virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the real DOM. React updates it first, then efficiently updates the real DOM based on differences.

### 98. How would you store non-state/instance variables in functional React components?

Use the useRef hook to store mutable values that persist across renders but don't trigger re-renders.

### 99. Explain why and when would you use useMemo()?

useMemo memoizes expensive calculations, preventing unnecessary recalculations on every render. Use it for performance optimization.

### 100. Why does React use SyntheticEvents?

SyntheticEvents provide a consistent, cross-browser wrapper around native events, normalizing behavior and improving compatibility.

### 101. What is the difference between using constructor vs getInitialState in React?

getInitialState is used in older React (createClass). In ES6 classes, use the constructor to initialize state.

### 102. Why would you need to bind event handlers to this?

Binding ensures that 'this' inside the handler refers to the component instance, allowing access to state and props.

### 103. What is the second argument that can optionally be passed to setState and what is its purpose?

The second argument is a callback function that runs after the state update and re-render are complete.

### 104. What's a Pure Functional Component in React?

A pure functional component renders the same output for the same props and has no side effects.

### 105. When is it important to pass props to super(), and why?

Always pass props to super() in the constructor to make them available as this.props in the component.

### 106. How to conditionally add attributes to React components?

Use JavaScript expressions or the spread operator to add attributes based on conditions. Example: <input disabled={isDisabled} />

### 107. Describe how events are handled in React

Events are handled using camelCase props and functions. React wraps events in SyntheticEvent for cross-browser consistency.

### 108. When would you use StrictMode component in React?

Use StrictMode during development to catch potential problems and ensure best practices.

### 109. How would you go about investigating slow React application rendering?

Use React DevTools Profiler, check for unnecessary re-renders, optimize components with memoization, and review state management.

### 110. Does React re-render all components and sub components every time setState is called?

No, only the component whose state changed and its children are re-rendered, unless prevented by shouldComponentUpdate or React.memo.

### 111. How to create Props Proxy for HOC component?

Pass all received props to the wrapped component using the spread operator: <WrappedComponent {...props} />

### 112. What's the difference between useCallback and useMemo in practice?

useCallback memoizes functions, while useMemo memoizes computed values.

### 113. How to avoid the need for binding in React?

Use arrow functions or class fields syntax to automatically bind methods to the class instance.

### 114. What is the key architectural difference between a JavaScript library such as React and a JavaScript framework such as Angular?

React is a library focused on the view layer, giving you more flexibility. Angular is a full framework with built-in solutions for routing, state, and more.

### 115. How does React renderer work exactly when we call setState?

React schedules a re-render, updates the virtual DOM, diffs it with the previous version, and applies minimal changes to the real DOM.

### 116. How to use React.memo()?

Wrap a functional component with React.memo to memoize it, preventing unnecessary re-renders when props haven't changed.

### 117. What is React Fiber?

React Fiber is the new reconciliation engine in React 16+, enabling incremental rendering and better performance.

### 118. Can a custom React hook return JSX?

No, hooks should return values or functions, not JSX. Only components should return JSX.

### 119. Explain some difference between Flux and AngularJS (1.x) approach

Flux uses unidirectional data flow and centralized state, while AngularJS uses two-way data binding and a more tightly coupled architecture.

### 120. What is the order of useInsertionEffect, useEffect and useLayoutEffect hooks at component generation ?

useInsertionEffect runs first, then useLayoutEffect, and finally useEffect after painting.

### 121. What is a Pure Function?

A pure function always returns the same output for the same input and has no side effects.

## React hooks

### 1. What are React Hooks?

Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components. They provide a more direct way to work with component logic.
Detailed explanation: Hooks were introduced in React 16.8 to allow you to use state and other React features without writing class components.

### 2. What is useState() in React?

useState is a Hook that lets you add React state to functional components.
Code example:

```jsx
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
const [user, setUser] = useState({ name: "", age: 0 });
```

### 3. How to call loading function with React useEffect only once?

To run an effect only once, pass an empty dependency array to useEffect.
Code example:

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  fetchData(); // This runs only on mount
}, []);
```

### 4. How to access DOM elements in React?

Use the useRef hook to access DOM elements directly in functional components.
Code example:

```jsx
const inputRef = useRef();
// Later in JSX
<input ref={inputRef} />;
// Access: inputRef.current.focus();
```

### 5. What are advantages of using React Hooks?

Hooks provide reusability of stateful logic, cleaner code organization, and avoid the complexity of class lifecycle methods.
Detailed explanation: They eliminate the need for HOCs and render props patterns, and make it easier to reuse stateful logic between components.

### 6. What are production use cases for the useRef?

useRef is commonly used for:

- Storing mutable values that don't trigger re-renders
- Accessing DOM elements directly
- Storing previous values
  Code example:

```jsx
const countRef = useRef(0); // Persists between renders
const prevCountRef = useRef(); // Store previous value
```

### 7. What does Batching mean in ReactJS?

Batching is React's way of grouping multiple state updates into a single re-render for better performance.
Detailed explanation: When multiple state updates occur within a single event handler or effect, React batches them together to avoid unnecessary re-renders.

### 8. What are common use cases for the useMemo?

useMemo is used for:

- Expensive calculations
- Referential equality in dependencies
- Preventing unnecessary re-renders
  Code example:

```jsx
const expensiveValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensive(a, b), [a, b]);
```

### 9. Which lifecycle methods of class component is replaced by useEffect in functional component?

useEffect replaces componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount.
Detailed explanation: Different combinations of useEffect with dependencies can replicate all lifecycle method behaviors.

### 10. When would you use useContext hook?

Use useContext when you need to consume context values in a functional component, avoiding prop drilling.
Code example:

```jsx
const value = useContext(MyContext);
```

### 11. Is there any problem when using useContext Hook?

Common issues include:

- Over-rendering when context value changes
- Performance concerns with large context values
- Unnecessary re-renders of child components

### 12. Do React Hooks cover all use cases for class components?

Most use cases are covered, but some features like Error Boundaries still require class components.
Detailed explanation: While hooks can handle most scenarios, there are still some edge cases where class components might be necessary.

### 13. How can I make use of Error Boundaries in functional React components?

Error Boundaries must be class components, but you can wrap functional components with them.
Code example:

```jsx
class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  // Error boundary implementation
}
// Usage
<ErrorBoundary>
  <FunctionalComponent />
</ErrorBoundary>;
```

### 14. What are differences between React.memo() and useMemo()?

React.memo memoizes an entire component, while useMemo memoizes a value.
Code example:

```jsx
// React.memo for component memoization
const MemoizedComponent = React.memo(MyComponent);
// useMemo for value memoization
const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeValue(a, b), [a, b]);
```

### 15. What are the advantages of Batching in ReactJS?

Batching improves performance by:

- Reducing the number of re-renders
- Grouping state updates together
- Preventing unnecessary DOM updates

### 16. Explain the difference between useState and useRef hooks?

useState triggers re-renders when updated, while useRef persists values between renders without causing re-renders.
Code example:

```jsx
const [state, setState] = useState(0); // Triggers re-render
const ref = useRef(0); // Doesn't trigger re-render
```

### 17. When would you use useRef?

Use useRef for:

- DOM element references
- Storing previous values
- Mutable values that don't need re-renders

### 18. Does React useState Hook update immediately?

No, useState updates are asynchronous and batched for performance.
Code example:

```jsx
setState(newValue); // This won't be available immediately
console.log(state); // Still shows old value
```

### 19. When writing a Custom Hook, what is the difference between it and a normal function?

Custom Hooks can use other hooks and follow hooks rules, while normal functions cannot use hooks.
Code example:

```jsx
// Custom Hook
function useCustomHook() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(0);
  return value;
}
```

### 20. Do two components using the same Hook share state?

No, each call to a Hook gets its own isolated state.
Detailed explanation: Hook calls in different components are completely independent.

### 21. How to use componentWillMount() in React Hooks?

There's no direct equivalent, but you can use useEffect with empty dependencies for similar behavior.
Code example:

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  // This runs after first render
}, []);
```

### 22. When shall we use useReducer hook in ReactJS?

Use useReducer for complex state logic or when state updates depend on multiple values.
Code example:

```jsx
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
```

### 23. Are there any problems using useCallback?

Common issues include:

- Over-optimization
- Creating unnecessary dependencies
- Complexity in maintenance

### 24. How would you store non-state/instance variables in functional React components?

Use useRef for mutable values that don't need to trigger re-renders.
Code example:

```jsx
const instanceValue = useRef(initialValue);
```

### 25. Is there a React hook equivalent to componentDidCatch?

No, error boundaries must still be implemented as class components.

### 26. When to use useState vs useReducer?

Use useState for simple state, useReducer for complex state logic or when state updates are related.
Detailed explanation: useReducer is preferable when you have complex state logic or need to manage multiple related state updates.

### 27. When would you use flushSync in ReactJS?

Use flushSync when you need to force React to flush state updates synchronously.
Code example:

```jsx
flushSync(() => {
  setState(newValue);
}); // State is updated synchronously
```

### 28. When to use useCallback, useMemo and useEffect?

- useCallback: Memoize functions
- useMemo: Memoize values
- useEffect: Handle side effects

### 29. How do I update state on a nested object with useState()?

Always create a new object when updating nested state.
Code example:

```jsx
setState((prev) => ({
  ...prev,
  nested: { ...prev.nested, value: newValue },
}));
```

### 30. Explain why and when would you use useMemo()?

Use useMemo to:

- Optimize expensive calculations
- Maintain referential equality
- Prevent unnecessary re-renders

### 31. What's the difference between useCallback and useMemo in practice?

useCallback memoizes functions, while useMemo memoizes values.
Code example:

```jsx
const memoizedFn = useCallback(() => doSomething(a, b), [a, b]);
const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => compute(a, b), [a, b]);
```

### 32. Do Hooks replace render props and higher-order components (HOC)?

Yes, hooks can replace most use cases for render props and HOCs, providing a more direct way to reuse logic.

### 33. How can I force component to re-render with Hooks in React?

Use a state update with a new reference to force a re-render.
Code example:

```jsx
const [, forceUpdate] = useState({});
const handleForceUpdate = () => forceUpdate({});
```

### 34. Can a custom React hook return JSX?

No, hooks should return values or functions, not JSX. Components should render JSX.

### 35. When would you want to avoid useEffect and use useLayoutEffect instead?

Use useLayoutEffect when you need to make DOM measurements or updates that must be synchronous and visible immediately.
